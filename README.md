# jeopardy_telegram_bot
A Telegram bot that gives you Jeopardy questions and tells you if you get them right (chatbot practice)

I made this chatbot to practice some .csv handling and chatbot building in general. I'm just learning as I go so many if not all things are suboptimal üëç
The bot can be found at @jeopardy_questions_bot in Telegram. It has to be started with /start or /hello, and then you can request questions with /ask or /play.
If you answer the bot will tell you if you got it right. You can request information about the question after that (year it aired, value, etc).

It's very easy to get the robot dizzy so be kind!! He will be smarter one day, maybe.

Currently trying to make the robot identify and keep track of independent user's sessions. As of right now if two people use it at the same time it gets pretty confused.
